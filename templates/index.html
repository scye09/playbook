    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally "black and white cat-foot"; Chinese: 大熊猫;
      pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally "big bear cat"),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda,
      is a bear[5] native to south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive
      black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda"
      is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order
      Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally
      eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity,
      they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially
      prepared food.[7][8] The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in
      Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[9] As a result of farming, deforestation,
      and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.
